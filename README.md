# SnappingVStack

Custom animation for vertical card scrolling. This animation was created for a player that would display the currently playing item in the center while applying a scale animation to both the current and the next items. 

The scroll animation is done using a VStack and a DragGesture due to the limitations of the ScrollView in SwiftUI that donesn't allow us to fully inspect the current scroll translation.
